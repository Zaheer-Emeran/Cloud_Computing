- Public cloud:  A CSP owns the cloud deployment and allocates its resources to external, unaffiliated customers. Those customers share the public cloudâ€™s resources without knowing precisely where their data is in relation to that of any other organization.
- Private cloud:  Services are provided to only a single organization.
- Hybrid cloud:  There is a combination of two or more private, public, or community deployments.
- Cloud Within a Cloud (Virtual Private Cloud)
- Multi-cloud
- Cloud Computing Elements: Resource Pools/Cloud Models and Services

### Cloud Delivery Models
- Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS):
- Platform as a Service (PaaS):
- Software as a Service (SaaS):

### The Computing Resources Life Cycle



### Mod 5
Standards are established common and repeatable practices that have been agreed to by a business or group. 

Multinational bodies:  Treaties or other similar international legal agreements typically govern these bodies. 

Industry consortiums:  A consortium is typically an organized group dedicated to developing standards for a specific industry requirement. 

An ad hoc group:  Ad hoc groups are self-organized and governed. These groups are often built around open-source initiatives. They can be a loose body that discusses their matters through an Internet message board, or they may be more formally organized.

De facto standards:  A de facto standard emerges when an approach or product is used so extensively used that it becomes a standard.
